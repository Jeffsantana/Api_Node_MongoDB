#How to Install
Using Git (recommended)
Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

Install npm dependencies after installing
cd ~/myproject
npm install
npm update

#Setting up environments (development or production)
In the root this repository you will find a file named .env.example
Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just .env
The file .env is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
Change the values of the file to your environment (development or production)
Upload the .env to your environment server(development or production)

#How to run development mode
cd ~/myproject
npm start
You will know server is running by checking the output of the command npm start:
